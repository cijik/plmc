 first_proposition_of_union_title: "Propose Triple Union"
 first_proposition_of_union_desc: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s health has been in decline for the last few years and it seems like [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] is going to die soon. The Sejm has considered inviting the Russian power in the region to take the Polish-Lithuanian throne. If their ruler agrees, this presents us with a unique and desirable opportunity to unite our countries as well. Together we shall withstand any foe."
 second_proposition_of_union_title: "Second Proposal of Union"
 second_proposition_of_union_desc: "Russian Tsardom is in dire times, the country is unstable and coups happen thick and fast. We could suggest boyars to elect Polish king on their throne to help them out of their misery and assert our dominance over all of Eastern Europe. If there was any time to realise the dream of Triple Union - it is now."
 third_proposition_of_union_title: "Third Proposal of Union"
 third_proposition_of_union_desc: "In the East the giant of Russia stands at our doorstep. Our proud people might still be the best soldiers of the known world, but the enemy outnumbers us forty to one man. But on the throne of the Russian Tsardom sits a brilliant woman. It seems that our salvation lies in realising the dream of our past, in uniting Rus and Commonwealth. Our king [Root.Monarch.GetName] is about to make a proposal to Russian tsaritsa, to marry our thrones and our countries. We can only hope it goes well."
 settle_russian_lands_title: "Colonise Russian Lands"
 settle_russian_lands_desc: "With full access to russian lands, we can pass a bill that will allow our people to freely travel in the lands of Union and to settle in Russian lands. If we come to agreement with russian boyars, we can even redistribute lands in favour of our colonists. This would have a drastic effect on people living there, polonise them and make them more unified."
