 muscovite_union.t.1:0 "Unia Troista"
 muscovite_union.d.1:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] is bedridden by his affliction, the Sejm has been in a heated debate over who we should elect as our next king, with pro-[UNION_TARGET.GetAdjective] faction winning the choice befell onto [UNION_TARGET.Monarch.GetName].\n A diplomatic envoy is being prepared to be sent into Russian lands with the best of diplomats we have available. Russians will undoubtedly make their demands, but with cunning words and some concessions, we hope to persuade them into not only taking our crown but also uniting our countries like Poland and Lithuania."
 muscovite_union.a.1:0 "Send the envoy!"
 muscovite_union.t.2:0 "Second Envoy"
 muscovite_union.d.2:0 "Russia is in Times Of Troubles, many pretenders are said to have been crowned as Tsar of all Rus. Some of our magnates have already attempted an intervention in this Chaos and king [Root.Monarch.GetName] has approved of it. If we use this opportunity to secure our hold over Eastern Europe we will be unstoppable. With that in mind maybe we should send our diplomats to suggest [Root.Monarch.GetName] as a new Tsar of all Rus' to Zemskiy Sobor?"
 muscovite_union.a.2:0 "After all, what harm could it do?"
 muscovite_union.t.3:0 "Third Envoy"
 muscovite_union.d.3:0 "As the mighty giant of Russia wakes it looks to its western borders, laying their eyes on our lands once again. We have been rivaling each other in strength for many ages but it seems that our golden age is slowly slipping away from our hands. Russian armies are simply too numerous in comparison to our own. However, on their throne sits a woman and this presents us with a great opportunity to save our country from falling into their hands. King [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proposed a marriage of Thrones and states to Tsaritsa [UNION_TARGET.Monarch.GetName]. If he can win her heart, then not only Rzeczpospolita will be saved, but our position as one of the strongest countries in all of Europe will be restored. This is a pivotal moment in our history and the best minds of Poland along with the king himself are going to attend [UNION_TARGET.Monarch.GetName]'s court personally in an attempt to win her heart."
 muscovite_union.a.3:0 "Commonwealth is not yet dead."
 
 muscovite_union.t.11:0 "Conversion of Muscovy"
 muscovite_union.d.11:0 "One of the issues that was brought up during our diplomatic talks was the conversion of Russia. While we accept all Christians in our lands, the Russians do not. We could demand their nobility to accept Catholicism to ease the future troubles. If they refuse it will certainly discourage their side from agreeing to our proposal, but their agreement would certainly guarantee our success."
 muscovite_union.a.11:0 "Demand Russian conversion"
 muscovite_union.b.11:0 "We shall not anger the bear"
 muscovite_union.t.12:0 "Polish demands"
 muscovite_union.d.12:0 "During the last round of talks, a representative of the Polish crown has declared their demand for us to convert to Catholicism, a branch of Christianity we persecute. A lot of boyars have been outraged by such demands, but surely this is worth the freedoms polish overlordship would present?"
 muscovite_union.a.12:0 "We are all Christians anyway"
 muscovite_union.b.12:0 "We will never abandon our faith!"
 muscovite_union.t.13:0 "Demand Ruthenia"
 muscovite_union.d.13:0 "Now that our round of talks have begun some of the boyars who happen to own land on the border with Rzeczpospolita suggested that we demand our ancestral lands in Ruthenia. Naturally, the new princes in our land would become their vassals. Even though it would upset the balance of power within the tsardom, it might still be worth it."
 muscovite_union.a.13:0 "Of course"
 muscovite_union.b.13:0 "We would rather not risk empowering other nobles"
 muscovite_union.t.14:0 "Transfer Ruthenia"
 muscovite_union.d.14:0 "The Russians have demanded that if our states are to be married, the lands of the old Kievan Rus that are currently owned by the Grand Duchy Of Lithuania should be transferred to them. Giving up those lands might be worth it, but the Lithuanian lords would surely sabotage such motion."
 muscovite_union.a.14:0 "Giving up the lands is worth it"
 muscovite_union.b.14:0 "This is outrageous!"
 muscovite_union.t.15:0 "End of negotiations"
 muscovite_union.d.15:0 "The diplomatic talks are nearing their conclusion and together with polish representatives a plan for the future Triple Union has been drafted. However, this would still mean that we are going to lose our independence to our western brothers. It is time to declare our verdict on the idea. Do we choose unity or do we choose independence?"
 muscovite_union.a.15:0 "We accept"
 muscovite_union.b.15:0 "We refuse"
 
 muscovite_union.t.21:0 "Reinforce Warsaw Compact in Union"
 muscovite_union.d.21:0 "Warsaw Compact or Warsaw Confederation was signed in the late 16th century and is meant to protect freedom of religion for free people in our lands, now that we are about to enter Union with Russia we can introduce a similar pact to them."
 muscovite_union.a.21:0 "Propose the offer"
 muscovite_union.b.21:0 "Refrain"
 muscovite_union.t.22:0 "Poles offer religious freedom"
 muscovite_union.d.22:0 "Polish sejm has suggested us to adopt a pact similar to their Warsaw Compact, they claim that with the times of religious struggles and what's more important our union having protected religious freedoms will make our country more stable and progressive."
 muscovite_union.a.22:0 "Take the offer"
 muscovite_union.b.22:0 "Refuse"
 muscovite_union.t.23:0 "Divide lands between Russia and PLC"
 muscovite_union.d.23:0 "Lands of Rus are rightfully ours and lands of Russia are rightfully theirs, but the border between the two was always blurred and caused our rulers to go to war with each other to conquer what was theirs by right. Now that we are aiming to achieve a union, we could suggest russians to solve the old dispute. Divide the lands of Ruthenia and Russia between Poland-Lithuania and [UNION_TARGET.GetName] correspondingly. The corrected borders should make unification easier for us."
 muscovite_union.a.23:0 "Send the suggestion"
 muscovite_union.b.23:0 "That's not a wise decision"
 muscovite_union.t.24:0 "Accept border corrections"
 muscovite_union.d.24:0 "During the last round of talks, Poles have suggested to correct borders between our countries. Ensure that Russian lands fully belong to us, and Kievan lands fully belong to them. It's an interesting idea, but some think that this will strengthen the Poles too much."
 muscovite_union.a.24:0 "Agree with proposed borders"
 muscovite_union.b.24:0 "Refuse to correct borders"
 muscovite_union.t.25:0 "End of negotiations"
 muscovite_union.d.25:0 "After all was said and done, the agreement on what would have to be done for the union to take place was achieved. However, this doesn't mean that everyone on Zemsky Sobor is happy about this decision. This is the last chance we have to send Poles and their king back home and keep our country to ourselves."
 muscovite_union.a.25:0 "We agree to the proposal"
 muscovite_union.b.25:0 "We don't need their King"
 
 muscovite_union.t.31:0 "Marriage Proposal from Polish Crown"
 muscovite_union.d.31:0 "For months now different nobles from Commonwealth have been attending our court, weaving intrigues and schemes to shift the opinion of nobles and subsequently of our Empress in his favour. Now at last he has arrived in person with his diplomats bearing a proposal. Proposal of marriage to our Empress and our state, he states that unification of our slavic countries will bring a golden age of prosperity for us both."
 muscovite_union.a.31:0 "[From.Monarch.GetName] is a charming man and a wise diplomat, we agree."
 muscovite_union.b.31:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will never stand for this!"
 
 muscovite_union.t.4:0 "New Tendencies?"
 muscovite_union.d.4:0 "After years of being in Unia Troista, many polish settlers and merchants have passed through our lands, resulting in some province adapting to the newcomers. The province of $PROVINCENAME$ has come to use a mix of polish and russian languages in their daily lives. And new settlers have brought with them new traditions that stayed in these lands."
 muscovite_union.a.4:0 "Worrying."
